# Changelog
Helheim: The structure of Helheim has changed, it is no longer completely buried underground, This means that the structure can now be seen in caves or on the surface. In addition, Helheim appears a little higher up.

### Bug Fixing
- The structure was not generated; it was positioned too low and there was insufficient space.
- Fixing Helblom, the villager now spawn correctly and the structure is tweaked.
- Some fixing in Asgard with some jigsaw replacement blocks name
