# Changelog
Helheim: The structure of Helheim has changed, it is no longer completely buried underground. This means that the structure can now be seen in caves or on the surface. In addition, Helheim appears a little higher up.

### Bug Fixes
- The structure was not generated because it was positioned too low and there was insufficient space.
- Fixed Helblom - the villager now spawns correctly and the structure is tweaked.
- Fixed some jigsaw replacement block names in Asgard.
