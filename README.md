# What is Yggdrasil ?
This pack adds gigantic structures that take hours to explore. Magnificent structures that spawn all over the world, and gives unique rewards, and combined with NeoEnchant it gets even better!
An unprecedented difficulty for the end of the game, Exclusive enchantments to be found in this structure if you use the NeoEnchant pack.

## Alfheim Structure
The Alfheim is a gigantic tree that spawns in the world. She is pink and flowery, on earth, under the earth and in the sky.

# Structure Overview
This pack currently introduces only one structure, which required over 100 hours of work and hundreds of files. It takes several hours to explore, offering unique rewards. The difficulty level is far superior to anything you've seen before! It utilizes the new Vault and Trial Spawner from version 1.21.

# Compatibility
For the best experience, we recommend using the **NeoEnchant+** pack, which adds custom enchantments to the game. However, it is not mandatory, and the structure will work without it

- **If NeoEnchant+ is installed:**
Monsters will be equipped with custom enchantments from the pack, as well as special custom ones for this occasion, and you'll find new custom enchantments for your weapons and armor.

- **If BeyondEnchant is installed:**
The enchantment level limit for mobs is also slightly increased.

- **If Custom Generation mods/pack is installed:**
Yggdrasil is fully compatible with generation mods that add new biomes or modify existing ones. The following Mods/Packs are confirmed to be supported.
if you use a mod that is not on this list, it may not be compatible with Yggdrasil, depending if the developer of the mod has updated the Minecraft "tag" system. if not don't worry, it just means that the structure will not appear in the biomes added by the mod, but it will still appear in other supported biomes and vanilla biomes.
